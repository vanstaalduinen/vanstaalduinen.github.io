		<h2>Afstudeerborrel</h2>
		<p>As you might know if you've reached this page, I have 'recently' completed my studies. That calls for a big party -- my 'afstudeerborrel'. I would love for you to be there! This page will be used to provide details once they become clear over time. For now, use the link below to register your interest in attending and receive updates in your mailbox. </p>
		<p>It is customary at an afstudeerborrel to have some presentations by various groups of friends. Should you want to organise something (please do!), you can contact Hermes Spaink, the master of ceremonies. You will receive his contact details in the mail after registering below.</p>
